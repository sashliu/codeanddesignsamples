# covetoolportfolio

In this repository I have included two urban studies projects, one is focused on development feasibility, and the other analyzes cases of sustainable architecture.

I have also included a mock up portfolio that I made for my UI/UX course which exemplifies my proficiency in HTML/CSS and Javascript. In this portfolio you can find
other UI/UX projects that I have worked on with a focus on increasing accessibility through improved user interfaces. 
The final product can be seen through this link https://wonkywombat789.github.io/finalportfolio/

Lastly, I have included a PDF with the findings from a deep learning project I did with fellow classmates. In this project we created a deep learning model
to classify a song's genre based on its audio spectogram imagery.
